      <img src="img/circus2.png" alt="Open Circus image">

      <p>Created by Peter Parker in 1964, the Wild Circus has since then travelled all America before going international in the early 80's.</p>

      <p>Peter Parker was a successfull Lion tamer who made a name for himself in the 50's allowing him to join the White Circus, The Jade Circus, amongst others. He decided to create is own troup to continue bringing joy around him as he reached an old age. Under his guidance the Wild quickly gained famed, thanks to his talent for finding incredible, innovative shows. In 1984 his son William Parker took up and followed with the tradition bringing to light famous artists such as The Black Eagles, The Jungling Twins and more. And now we are still on the road every year with new additions to the show, always seeking new ways to amaze you and bring joy into your town.</p>
